# Pasture Management

API Data Driven with ASP.NET Core 3 and EF Core 3

An API that provides CRUD operations for managing pasture herds.

## Why?

Data Driven is a software development approach that consists of creating classes without business rules that aim to provide a representation of the database and make CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of the entities.

This approach is indicated in applications with few business rules where a simpler architecture will meet the project's demand, enabling greater productivity.
